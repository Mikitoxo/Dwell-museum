# Dwell-museum
This is my first project on git...or anywhere else for that matter.
About: This is meant to be a landing page for a museum.
Description: A basic...very basic website made using html, CSS and JS. It is my very first project and I'm really proud of it lol.
Purpose and Main features: Information about the (fictional) Dwell museum, a quiz about Frida Kahlo(absolutely looovee Frida), map integration on the location page, a copy function on the contacts page, very simple and basic.
